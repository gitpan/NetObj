NetObject 1.0 alpha 1
---------------------

This is the first release of NetObject.
It is a module that allows you to create a TCP based client/server module
distribution platform.  

INSTALLATION
------------

	You need the Compiler-Alpha-3 module with the
	-DINDIRECT_BGET_MACROS definition to make NetObj 
	run!

	1) Untar and unzip the distribution archive
	2) type 'perl configure'
	3) type 'perl Makefile.PL'
	4) run 'make'
	5) run 'make install'


CREATION OF ASM MODULE FILES
----------------------------

  To create an asm module is fairly simple.  In the directory in which
  the foo.pm file lies,  type the following:

	perl -MO=Bytecode,-m,-ofoo.pmb foo.pm

  This will create the foo.pmb bytecompiled module.  You now need to convert
  this to assembler code. To do so,  use the file 'disassemble' in the
  Compiler module's directory.  It works like this:

	disassemble foo.pmb > foo.asm

  Then copy the foo.asm file to the directory you specified as the assembler
  home directory.

Hope you have fun.
